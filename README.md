# Information Co-op


## Introduction

[This website](http://votermedia.info) is for an information usersâ€™ cooperative, to develop and manage an online system for buying and selling information. This could be useful for a broad range of types of information. As an example and starting point, we could consider info helpful to retail consumers in a given city such as Vancouver, Canada: E.g. where are the best bargains today on telecom services, banking, gasoline or whatever? There are free websites with info like this, but paying for it should generate more useful info.

For details, please see [*Info Co-op Outline*](http://votermedia.org/publications/InfoCoopOutline.pdf).
