# /etc/init/puma.conf - Puma config

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Puma instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See workers.conf for how to manage all Puma instances at once.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/puma.conf then manage puma with:
#   sudo start puma
#   sudo stop puma
#   sudo status puma
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service puma {start,stop,restart,status}
#

# no "start on", we don't want to automatically start
stop on (stopping puma-manager or runlevel [06])

# change apps to match your deployment user if you want to use this as a less privileged user (recommended!)
